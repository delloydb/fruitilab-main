# 🍇 Fruitilab – The AI-Prompted, Vibe-Coded Fruit Experience

Welcome to **Fruitilab**, a fully AI-crafted, frontend-only web project that celebrates the world of fruits in the most colorful, interactive, and educational way possible. Every line of code — from structure to styling, interactivity to corrections — was generated through natural language prompts using the power of AI.

This project was built in a uniquely immersive style called **Vibe Coding** — an experience of building while flowing to the timeless rhythms of Mozart, Beethoven, Vivaldi, Bach, Dmitri, and the swirling waltzes of all eras. 🎶✨
